    "# Part 1: Which reports are safe?\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.\n",
    "    Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the reports can be found safe or unsafe by checking those rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    7 6 4 2 1: Safe because the levels are all decreasing by 1 or 2.\n",
    "    1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe because 2 7 is an increase of 5.\n",
    "    9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe because 6 2 is a decrease of 4.\n",
    "    1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe because 1 3 is increasing but 3 2 is decreasing.\n",
    "    8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe because 4 4 is neither an increase or a decrease.\n",
    "    1 3 6 7 9: Safe because the levels are all increasing by 1, 2, or 3.\n"
